Also needed few fixes on add new chat.

### Achieving Test Cases on the Frontend

To implement test cases on the frontend, we can use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration testing. Writing component tests, simulating user interactions, and ensuring API responses work as expected will help in validating the functionality and stability of the application.
